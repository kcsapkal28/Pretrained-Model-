# Objective

The primary objective of this project is to understand, implement, and evaluate Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequence prediction tasks. We aim to study how LSTM architectures can model sequential data and apply these insights to build a text or handwriting generation system.

Title: Generating Sequences with Recurrent Neural Networks
Author: Alex Graves
Publication Year: 2013
Summary

This seminal paper explores the use of LSTM networks for generating sequences by predicting the next element in a sequence based on previously seen data. It addresses major challenges in sequence modeling, including learning long-range dependencies and producing coherent outputs over long generated sequences.
Core Approaches

    Deep LSTM Architectures: The study highlights the importance of stacking multiple LSTM layers to enhance the model's ability to learn hierarchical representations of sequential data.

    Autoregressive Generation: Outputs are generated one step at a time, with each prediction fed back into the model as input for the next prediction.

# Network Architecture

    Multi-layer LSTM: The network consists of several LSTM layers stacked vertically, allowing the model to learn both low-level and high-level temporal patterns.

    Softmax Output Layer: For sequence generation tasks such as text prediction, a softmax layer is used to produce probability distributions over the next possible characters.

# Training Strategy

    Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT): Standard backpropagation is adapted to handle sequences by unfolding the network over time steps.

    Gradient Clipping: Used to avoid the issue of exploding gradients during training.

    Dropout Regularization: Applied to prevent overfitting, especially in deep LSTM models.

    Teacher Forcing: During training, the true previous token is provided as input for the next step rather than the model’s prediction, stabilizing and accelerating convergence.

# Evaluation Metrics

    Cross-Entropy Loss: Measures the divergence between the predicted probability distribution and the actual distribution.

    Qualitative Evaluation: Subjective assessment of generated sequences in terms of coherence, grammaticality (for text), and realism (for handwriting).

# Additional Context on LSTM

LSTM networks, introduced by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997), are a special kind of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) capable of learning long-term dependencies. They are explicitly designed to combat the vanishing gradient problem that traditional RNNs suffer from, using gates (input, forget, output) to control the flow of information through the cell.

Key Features of LSTMs:

    Ability to learn when to forget and when to remember.

    Capable of handling both short-term and long-term patterns.

    Widely used for tasks like machine translation, time series forecasting, and speech recognition.

Justification for Paper Selection

The paper by Alex Graves stands out for its pioneering exploration of LSTM-based sequence generation. Its contributions extend beyond architecture design into practical aspects such as training strategies and evaluation techniques, which are critical for building reliable and performant sequence models. Given the alignment with our goal of building LSTM-based sequence predictors, this paper serves as a foundational and practical guide for our project.
